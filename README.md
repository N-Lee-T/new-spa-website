# Building a new website

I'm creating a new personal website as a single-page application using React. Since I learned a little bit of React / react-router-dom 5.x.x, it's taking a little bit of research to figure out the syntax.

## Updates:

A very basic skeletal site now works. It'll be styled soon, and hopefully will replace my current website by the end of the summer!
